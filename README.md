This is a website similar to Udemy, wherein there are two profiles: Admin and users. The admin can sign up for the website and upload desirable courses with desirable     components like topics, prices, lengths, etc. The users need to sign up and purchase the course they want. I built this using the MERN stack. 

=> Run the index.js file in the root to see the working of the website (Use Postman as of now). 

=> As of now only the skeleton of the backend is built i.e., admins/users can sign up. I used JWT for authentication. Admins can upload their courses but there is no     front end now. And a Mongo DB must be connected. no payment gateway yet. 

=> But the core of the website (Back-end logic) is done, and the entire website will be ready very soon.
